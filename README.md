# Oblivion

Oblivion is my latest rice. I plan on upgrading this and using this for quite some time since I like the 
fluidity and the feel of it.

Main programs used:
- vim(nvim)
- zathura
- lf 
- zsh
- mpd
- feh

It's a very minamalistic approach since everything is in .config and .local.
There are bunch of scripts I find very useful.
